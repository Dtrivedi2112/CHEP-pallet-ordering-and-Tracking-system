# CHEP-pallet-ordering-and-Tracking-system

This is my very first project which I have successfully sold to Velisha Farms

The pallet ordering, and tracking system is a windows software application which can calculate the pallets & crates, also can break down the ordering of the order quick and easy.


Features:
•	Enter the orders of products and it will give you the perfect combination possible
•	Calculate the total amount of pallets for truck
•	Calculate the total amount of crates (48,34,22) except the cardboard boxes
•	Display’s the today’s date
•	Emails the total pallets and crates 
•	Emails the data in proper format with date as subject line so reader doesn’t need to open all emails to find the numbers of any day
•	Emails the Docket number, CHEP number and Purchase order number to make sure the order dispatch is correct 
•	It also has a function of printing the document which is used by forklift drivers.

Advantages
•	Exact calculation of pallets and crates
•	Efficient for the truck company
•	Through understanding by workers in production
•	From 15-20 min calculation to 30 sec calculation
•	Training program for forklift drivers
•	Saves nearly $6205 per year & time related to the forklift drivers 
•	Saves approximately $1500 per year or more for mistakenly not loading the products.

Works for
•	CHEP crates

•	Can be updated if any new product is introduced


Own project: While working as a forklift driver, I must sit down and calculate the orders for dispatching to ALDI which took 15-20 min calculation

o	Researched a solution which can improve the process and came up with an efficient solution
o	Developed a Windows Form application which in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 which can calculate the orders and breakdown into combinations and pallets which any forklift driver can understand and can be done in 30 secs
o	Works for CHEP crates and pallets
o	Stored the pallet data by making switch cases and list for every textbox and when the information is called by the user and it displays on screen

Sold the software to the company.
